# The Peak VL Climber - Pomodoro App

An interactive Pomodoro application designed to help users reach their **"Flow State"**. Built with Flutter, this project demonstrates advanced UI responsiveness and mathematical animation logic.

## Key Technical Insights
To meet the high standards of performance and accessibility, I implemented:
- **Percentage-based Positioning:** Moved away from fixed pixel values to a 0.0-1.0 ratio system, ensuring the climber stays on track across all screen sizes (Mobile/Web).
- **Dynamic Animation Logic:** Utilized `Timer.periodic` and trigonometry for the "Congratulations" UI effects.
- **Analytical Problem Solving:** Structured data-driven movement paths to synchronize perfectly with a 25-minute countdown.
